# Android-Malware-Detection
Investigation of Android Malware Detection Technique using Machine Learning

In this approach using Machine learning algorithms to detect Malicious and Benign app with the help of Static feature available in Android dataset. 
In this approach, we used different algorithm’s and compare which one algorithm gives better model to classified malicious app.
This approach further developed into a software and an application.

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, SVM, Decision tree, Navie Baye’s, and Ensembled methods.
